# About Richardson Maturity Model \(RMM\) for Services

Richardson Maturity Model \(RMM\) itâ€™s a model developed by **Richardson, Leonard **that helps organize your REST APIs in some levels, described below.

The importance of this topic is key, once we have to create and maintain better services APIs.

The main reason for this model to exist is to foster the evolution of the REST APIs of some system with a constant concern of Governance, sense of organization with retrocompatibility and constant improvements, using all characteristics available from the REST architecture style.

Below we have an overview of all layers within the RMM model, described in the following topics:

### **Level 0 = **Swamp of Pox

In this level, you should have a service already exposing a resource via its URI using only one HTTP verb \(usually GET or POST\). In this phase you only use HTTP as a transport system \(think of it as a RPC using HTTP\).

### **Level 1 = Resources**
